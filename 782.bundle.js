Kasi hindi naman na matatapos kaya wag nalang bilangin, jok. It's still important to pay attention to those small details and appreciate it. Also, I think we should not be harsh on ourselves/each other. We've been through a lot and we are still standing, we experienced arguments, misunderstandings, and fights, which did put us to a critical situation. Despite all of that, look at us, we are still together. I believe in us, I believe in you, we have a bright future ahead please bear with me hihi 😁.

We are not perfect but we are perfect for each other. I know we have frequent unwell moments this past few days/weeks but we always make our way out of it right? I mean we solve it one way or another. These moments are challenges for us, we are being set up by the world, it is up on us on how we react/respond on them. We will fight bb, are you with me? I'm sorry for not being initiative, it sounds tuloy na ikaw lang yung may gusto ng ginagawa natin and nagcocomply lang ako. Pero I do care bb, I like what we are doing, it's just that naging habit ko na siguro hindi maging pushy kasi it is set in my mind na that's not how to be gentle. Kaso yon I mixed up balancing gentleness and initiative, pero don't worry bb I'm working on it na 😄. Also bb, I always do what I want, I'm sorry if iba yung dating ng acts ko kapag tumitiming na may issue or katatapos lang ng issue tapos magmamyday ako, it's not like I'm doing it to compensate or what. I just feel like posting and most of the time kapag hindi tayo okay, nagkakatime ako magscroll sa past pictures natin kaya dun ako nagkakaurge magmyday, which is I get it it's confusing kasi hindi naman ako myday person before and anonymous type ako hoho.
